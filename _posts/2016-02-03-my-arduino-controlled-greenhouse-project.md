# My Arduino-Controlled Greenhouse Project

I want to automate my germination station for seed starting this spring and eventually expand the setup to control an entire greenhouse and/or garden.

Now, I know nothing about coding and nothing about electronics, so I'm starting from scratch here. I'm beginning by going through a Make book with example projects for starters. Several of the circuits have been built and coded already and I think I have a strong enough foundation to expand out to sensor inputs and logged outputs.
